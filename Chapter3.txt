Dear Lord Jesus, I believe in you today, you died for my sins and you rose again so that I can receive eternal Life. Lord Jesus, I acknowledge that I’m a sinner, so I ask in your mercy to forgive me my sin, redeem me and wash me in your precious blood. I also ask you to come into my life and be my Lord from now on. Amen.
Friend, you are saved if you pray this prayer. So I congratulate you and I pray that the Grace of God will uphold you till the end! You will not fall, draw back nor lured back into the world. He will help you stand and continually order your steps aright. If there be any challenges you are experiencing now, God will intervene and show you His mercy. Amen.
Finally, get committed to the reading of God’s Word and start fellowshipping with God’s own people in Church. The Lord Bless You!
