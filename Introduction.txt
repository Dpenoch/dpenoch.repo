GOD’S GREATEST GIFT TO YOU

Dear Friend,
JESUS is the way, the truth, and the Life. He came to this world to die for the sins of men on the cross, so that we can receive the gift of eternal Life through Christ Jesus.
All men became a sinner through the disobedience of one man which made us subject to death. For scripture says: …all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.
