Friend, God love us so much that he doesn’t want us to continue in that state (SINNER) of existence. So he gave us his only Son Jesus Christ to redeem us from sin by shedding of His blood that we might receive the forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ. God doesn’t want you to perish but to have eternal Life. That’s why Christ came to die for your sins on the Cross, he was buried, and he rose again on the third day according to the scriptures.
